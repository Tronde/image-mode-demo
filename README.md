# RHEL image mode demo

This repository contains scripts and files I use as supplementary material for my demos and workshops on [RHEL image mode](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel-image-mode/overview). It is referenced by some introduction and tutorial I'm currently working on.

Feel free to use the content of this repo at your own risk for your own purposes. Only do me the favor and don't run the simple registry in production with my default passwords, as that would be bad practice. ;-)
